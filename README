Developer's note (and murmur)
-----------------------------

- The document guide to use GET method. However POST method is allowed as well. This would be changed in the future version.
- `doc/kotsms-api.yml` is the api document in Swagger [1] 2.0 format.
- Does anyone know what does the "kot" mean?
